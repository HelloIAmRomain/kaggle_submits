# Kaggle competition: [Minst dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer)

This dataset is very popular, so let's use it as a training and do our best to overcome this challenge.

## Data

The data is in the `data` folder. It contains `train.csv` and `test.csv`.

The objective is to predict the digit in the image. The data is in the form of a 28x28 pixel image. Each pixel is represented by a number between 0 and 255. The number represents the darkness of the pixel. 0 is white and 255 is black.

## Different approaches
1. Support Vector Machine
2. Random Forest
3. Convolutional Neural Network (Keras)
